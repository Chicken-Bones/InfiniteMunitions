Adds endless quivers and musket pouches for every arrow and bullet in the game.

Craft by upgrading an endless quiver or endless musket pouch with 4 stacks of a specific ammo type (for example, 1x Endless Quiver + x3996 (or 4 stacks) Silver Bullets = 1x Endless Silver Bullet Pouch).

Most importantly, press Q (configurable) to change ammo while using a weapon! Also works for swapping the spectre hood/helmet while holding a mage weapon.

Also adds endless health and mana potions (only for the Super ones).

NOTES:
- Trying to craft an Endless Tungsten Bullet Pouch will result in an Endless Silver Bullet Pouch as they are of the same tier and serve the same functionality.

UPCOMING (whenever):
- Infinite dart items and rockets.
- A "Mobius Star" (infite star ammo) for the Star Cannon.
