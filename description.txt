Adds endless quivers and musket pouches for every arrow and bullet in the game.

Craft at a Crystal Ball with 3996 of a specific ammo type (for example, x3996 Silver Bullets = 1x Endless Silver Bullet Pouch).

Most importantly, press Q (configurable) to change ammo while using a weapon! Also works for swapping the spectre hood/helmet while holding a mage weapon.

Also adds:
- Endless Health and Mana Potions. Craft with 120 Super Health/Mana Potions at a Crystal Ball.
- Wormhole Mirror. Craft with 20 Wormhole Potions and a Magic/Ice Mirror.

NOTES:
- Trying to craft an Endless Tungsten Bullet Pouch will result in an Endless Silver Bullet Pouch as they are of the same tier and serve the same functionality.

CANCELLED (artist busy):
- Infinite dart items and rockets.
- A "Mobius Star" (infite star ammo) for the Star Cannon.
